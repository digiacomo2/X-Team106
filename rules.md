# X-Team 106 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Volunteer first, then if there are none leader will decide evenly.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
On Wednesdays talk after class. Comment and describe changes.


## How will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Email chains and canvas group page.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
If someone is struggling reach out to get help from other people in the group. 
We will also schedule times to meet and program together.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Discuss certain parts of code for implentation clarification before coding.
